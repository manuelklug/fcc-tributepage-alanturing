			    <h1>Who was Alan Turing?</h1>
			    <p>Alan Turing was a brilliant British mathematician who took a leading role in breaking Nazi ciphers during WWII. In his seminal 1936 paper, he proved that there cannot exist any universal algorithmic method of determining truth in mathematics, and that mathematics will always contain undecidable propositions. His work is widely acknowledged as foundational research of computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>

			    <h1>Cracking the Uncrackable</h1>
			    <p>Working in secret as part of the massive Bletchley Park cryptology operation, Alan Turing helped crack the Nazi military’s vexing Enigma machine. Since it possessed a set of rotors that were constantly scrambled to confuse the Allies, the encryption device had quintillions of possible settings. German military assumed there simply wasn’t enough time to break it. Turing’s breakthrough came from observing that morning U-boat communications included a weather report, a pattern to be exploited. He then built a gargantuan machine that could quickly sort through millions of possibilities to divine the code. The first of many, the device set the stage for a massive computing operation that would eventually crack up to two messages a minute.</p>

			    <h1>True to himself</h1>
			    <p>Turing had never been secretive about his homosexuality. He was outspoken and exuberant about his lifestyle, openly taking male lovers. When police discovered his sexual relationship with a young man, he was arrested and came to trial in 1952. Turing never denied or defended his actions, instead asserting that there was nothing wrong with what he did. The courts disagreed, and Turing was convicted of gross indecency. In order to avoid prison, Turing had to agree to undergo a series of estrogen injections.</p>
			    <p>He continued his work in quantum physics and in cryptanalytics, but known homosexuals were ineligible for security clearance. Bitter over being turned away from the field he had revolutionized, Turing committed suicide in 1954 by ingesting cyanide.</p>
